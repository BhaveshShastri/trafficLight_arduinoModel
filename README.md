# trafficLight_arduinoModel
Aim - An Arduino based traffic light simulator using LED.

Objectives – 
1. To understand applications of traffic light simulator used in the transportation industry, urban  planning, and traffic engineering.
   
Components Required –
1. Arduino
2. USB Cable
3. 1KΩ Resistor into three
4. LED – Red, Yellow, Green
5. Jumper wires
6. Bread board

Steps:
The methodology used for building the Arduino-based traffic light simulator is as follows:
• Connect the three LEDs to the digital pins of the Arduino board using the breadboard.
• Write the program code for the traffic light sequence using the Arduino IDE.
• Compile the program code and rectify any error if indicating in console.
• Upload the program to the Arduino board using a USB cable.
• Test the traffic light sequence and adjust the duration of each signal as needed
