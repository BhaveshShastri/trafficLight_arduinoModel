# Traffic Light Arduino Model

## Objectives
1. Understand applications of traffic light simulator used in the transportation industry, urban planning, and traffic engineering.

## Components Required
1. Arduino
2. USB Cable
3. 1KΩ Resistor (x3)
4. LEDs – Red, Yellow, Green
5. Jumper wires
6. Breadboard

## Steps
The methodology for building the Arduino-based traffic light simulator:
1. Connect the three LEDs to the digital pins of the Arduino board using the breadboard.
2. Write the program code for the traffic light sequence using the Arduino IDE.
3. Compile the program code and rectify any errors indicated in the console.
4. Upload the program to the Arduino board using a USB cable.
5. Test the traffic light sequence and adjust the duration of each signal as needed.
